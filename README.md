## Introduction

In this repository, we implement multiple recommendation systems to personalize your movie-watching experience. These systems range from traditional methods to advanced neural networks, each with its unique approach to predicting what you'll enjoy next.

## Recommendation Systems Implemented

### 1. TensorFlow Recommenders: Collaborative Filtering

**Overview:**
Harness the power of TensorFlow Recommenders for collaborative filtering. This system focuses on learning from user interactions to make accurate movie suggestions.

**Key Components:**
- **Embeddings:** Learns dense representations for users and movies.
- **Retrieval Task:** Uses embeddings to retrieve the top-K recommendations for users.
- **Evaluation:** Measures the modelâ€™s performance to ensure high-quality suggestions.
- **Custom Functions:** Provides tailored recommendations for users and finds movies similar to those they like.

**Dataset:** Movielens 100k

### 2. Keras: Matrix Factorization

**Overview:**
Matrix factorization with Keras offers a powerful way to decompose the user-item interaction matrix, revealing latent features that predict user preferences.

**Key Components:**
- **Data Preparation:** Encodes user and movie IDs and splits the dataset for training and testing.
- **Neural Network:** Builds a neural network with embedding layers for users and movies.
- **Training:** Uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss for optimization.
- **Recommendations:** Generates movie suggestions based on learned user preferences.

**Dataset:** Movielens 100k

### 3. TF-IDF & Collaborative Filtering: Hybrid Approach

**Overview:**
Combine the strengths of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering with a hybrid model. This method integrates TF-IDF vectorization for movie titles with user rating patterns to provide well-rounded recommendations.

**Key Components:**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts movie titles into numerical vectors based on term frequency-inverse document frequency.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates the similarity between movies using TF-IDF vectors.
- **User Ratings:** Enhances recommendations by factoring in user rating patterns and preferences.

**Dataset:** Movielens 25m

### 4. Deep Learning: Neural Collaborative Filtering (just tried)

**Overview:**
Explore advanced neural collaborative filtering techniques using deep learning. This approach models complex interactions between users and movies through deep neural networks.

**Key Components:**
- **Embedding Layers:** Creates dense vector representations for users and movies.
- **Dense Layers:** Stacks fully connected layers to capture intricate user-movie interactions.
- **Training:** Optimizes the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
- **Interactive Widgets:** Provides an interactive interface for users to select movies and get recommendations, or find similar movies.

**Dataset:** Movielens 25m

## Setup and Usage

### Running the Recommendation Systems

Each recommendation system is encapsulated in a Colab notebook: **movie_recommendation_system.ipynb**. Open the notebook, follow the instructions, and start exploring the models.
