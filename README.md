# Movie Recommendation Systems

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Systems repository! Here, you'll find multiple implementations of recommendation systems that help you discover movies youâ€™ll love. Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a machine learning expert, or just a movie buff, there's something here for you.

## Recommendation Systems Implemented

### **1. Collaborative Filtering with TensorFlow Recommenders**

**Description:**
Dive into the world of collaborative filtering with TensorFlow Recommenders. This system uses user interactions to find patterns and suggest movies.

**Dataset:** Movielens 100k dataset.

**Key Features:**

- **User and Movie Embeddings:** Learns and uses embeddings for users and movies to provide recommendations.
- **Top-K Recommendations:** Defines a retrieval task to predict the top-K recommendations tailored to each user.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Trains the model and evaluates its performance for reliable recommendations.
- **Custom Functions:** Includes functions to recommend movies for specific users and find similar movies based on user preferences.

### **2. Matrix Factorization with Keras**

**Description:**
Implement matrix factorization using Keras to provide collaborative filtering recommendations. This method factors the user-item interaction matrix to identify latent features.

**Dataset:** Movielens 100k dataset.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Loads user ratings and movie details, and preprocesses data by encoding user and movie IDs.
- **Neural Network Model:** Constructs a neural network with embeddings for users and movies.
- **Training with SGD:** Trains the model using the SGD optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides functions to recommend movies based on user preferences.

### **3. Content-Based Filtering with TF-IDF and Collaborative Filtering**

**Description:**
Combines the power of TF-IDF for content-based filtering with collaborative filtering for recommendations, offering a hybrid approach.

**Dataset:** Movielens 25m dataset.

**Key Features:**

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Cleans and vectorizes movie titles using TF-IDF.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Implements functions to find movies similar to a given title based on cosine similarity of TF-IDF vectors.
- **User Preferences:** Utilizes user ratings to recommend movies that similar users have rated highly.

### **4. Neural Collaborative Filtering with Deep Learning**

**Description:**
Explore deep learning for recommendation systems with neural collaborative filtering, integrating embeddings and neural networks for advanced movie recommendations.

**Dataset:** Movielens 25m dataset.

**Key Features:**

- **Embedding Layers:** Builds user and movie embeddings using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Dense Layers:** Uses dense layers for learning non-linear interactions between user and movie embeddings.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Trains the model and evaluates its performance on a test set.
- **Interactive Widgets:** Provides interactive widgets to select users and movies, and get recommendations or find similar movies.
